## Our Mission ##
We realize that there are many ways for current computer users to measure their computer's performance. These include, but are not limited to:
- The Windows Performance Index
- Their processor's clock speed
- How fast Facebook loads
- How good their games look
- Etc.
You get the idea. We saw all of this and realized something: it's all bullshit! We thought that we should just cut the shit and get straight to the point: for all but the most intensive users, performance benchmarks are bullshit. So we created _The Bullshit Performance Standard_ to fill this
