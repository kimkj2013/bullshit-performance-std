# The Bullshit Performance Standard (BSPS)#
#### Original Code and Concept by Nate Mara and Daltin Loomis ####
##### Honorable Mention goes to John Shaver #####

## Our Mission ##
We realize that there are many ways for current computer users to measure their computer's performance. These include, but are not limited to:
- The Windows Performance Index
- Their processor's clock speed
- How fast Facebook loads
- How good their games look
- Etc.

You get the idea. We saw all of this and realized something: it's all bullshit! We thought that we should just cut the shit and get straight to the point: for all but the most intensive users, performance benchmarks are bullshit. So we created _The Bullshit Performance Standard_ to fill this obvious gap in the performance measurement game.

##How Does it Work?##
_The Bullshit Performance Standard_ uses a very advanced method of calculating performance for your machine. All current impementations of the BSPS use identical methods for their performance calculation, they simply use different languages.

1. When the program begins, a new file is created ("bull.shit")
2. The program writes 50,000,000 copies of the string "bullshit" to this file
3. The time that this operation takes is printed to the console
4. The file is deleted

The BSPS consists of the time that is given to the user at the end of the benchmark's execution is your machine's BSPS score, or BSPSS. So what are you waiting for?

##How to use?##
To get this fantastic benchmarking suite onto your machine and start testing, follow these steps: 

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/natemara/bullshit-performance-std.git` 
2. Run the BSPI
	a. `cd bin`
	b. `bs`
	c. Your score will be written to the console in milliseconds of time
3. Brag about your score on the internet!
